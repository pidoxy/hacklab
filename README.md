# PheraCam

## Problem Statement
    The insecurity in Nigeria is increasing exponentially with each passing day.
    Insecurity and terrorism have been a major challenge for the Nigerians and 
    the government lately, each of which leads to the loss of properties and the 
    destruction of properties. Lack of working systems has led to high crime rate 
    without penalty for crimes ,there are even cases of the wrong individual 
    accused for crimes they did not commit. 

    Which brings us to the big question

    How might we us solve Insecurity?


## Concept

Our concept is based on 

    * THEME: Accelerating Artificial Intelligence & big data through edge computing <img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2022-06-11 at 20 42 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56538561/173213046-5249e165-b28b-4a21-868d-5cc202f365e6.png">

and

    * SUB THEME: Internet of things at the edge

### Our Solution

PheraCAM is an AI-Based Security and protection System that uses
facial recognition and edge computing to alert you when
an unregistered face is detected, causing you to make 
necessary actions when your property is pose to a threat.

Everyone wants to be secured or letâ€™s say have some sort
of security including our users.
Our users build wealth to be able to have some level of 
security and we are using this product to give our users 
by exploring the effective use of face recognition in our day
to day to protect your property against theft and crime.

Hence, we can make our users sleep better at night. 


## How The Solution Works

A basic flow is our cameras(sensors) pick up raw data and transact with the cloud 
for edge speed processing and then return data to the web app where the user can 
access
